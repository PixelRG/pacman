# Welcome to my project

## About
This is a game based upon Pacman.  
This game was modified by introducing:
* maze generation by using depth-first search algorithm with recursive backtracking
* A star pathfinding by using Manhattan distances so ghosts can hunt pacman mo

## Development story
This project was built when I was doing my final year as an A level student.  
I only spent about 3 months in this project.
This game is far from polished in terms of game design and meeting all of my goals for computer science NEA

## Features of the project accomplished:  
* Maze generation using depth first algorithm with recursive backtracking
* 4 Ghosts and their hunting strategies complete
* A star pathfinding
* Pacman
* Score system and saving scores in a text file
* Ghost frightened mode

## Future improvements:  
* better designs for the sprites
* Better look of the maze
